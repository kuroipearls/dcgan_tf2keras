DCGAN - Keras & Tensorflow 2 Implementation
-------------------------------------------

This is a simple implementation of `DCGAN <https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434>`_ (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) using Keras & Tensorflow 2. 

Please install **Tensorflow >= 2.2.0**, and if you want to use tensorflow-gpu, make sure you install **CUDA 10.1**. 

This repo is inspired from `Keras documentation <https://keras.io/examples/generative/dcgan_overriding_train_step/>`_. 

To start training, simply type:
::
	>>> python main.py

Note: It's still WIP, but the training process is available to run.
